# 🚀 Multi-Version Database Manager with Docker & Make (multi-db-docker-env)

[!["Buy Us A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jmrenouard)

A modular Docker-based lab for running and testing multiple versions of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra.

This project provides a flexible development environment to quickly launch and manage different versions of MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona Server using Docker, Docker Compose, and a `Makefile` for streamlined operations.

A key feature is the **Traefik reverse proxy**, which ensures all database instances are accessible through a single, stable port on your host machine (`localhost:3306`), regardless of which specific database version you choose to run.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)
*   `make` (available on most Linux/macOS systems. For Windows, you can use Chocolatey: `choco install make`)

## ⚙️ Initial Setup

The only required configuration step is to set the root password for your databases.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.
2.  Add the following line, replacing `your_super_secret_password` with a strong password of your choice (do not use quotes around the password):

    ```env
    # File: .env
    DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_super_secret_password
    ```

⚠️ **Important**: This `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` is crucial for the `make mycnf` and `make client` commands to function correctly.

## ✨ Usage with Makefile

The `Makefile` is the main entry point for managing the environment. It simplifies all operations into short, memorable commands.

### General Commands

These commands help you manage and interact with the overall environment.

| Command         | Icon | Description                                                                 | Example Usage         |
| :-------------- | :--- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `make help`     | 📜   | Displays the full list of all available commands.                           | `make help`           |
| `make stop`     | 🛑   | Stops and properly removes all containers and networks for this project.    | `make stop`           |
| `make status`   | 📊   | Shows the status of the project's active containers (Traefik + DB).         | `make status`         |
| `make info`     | ℹ️   | Provides information about the active DB service and recent logs.           | `make info`           |
| `make logs`     | 📄   | Displays logs for the currently active database service (or all if none).   | `make logs`           |
| `make mycnf`    | 🔑   | Generates a `~/.my.cnf` file for password-less `mysql` client connections.  | `make mycnf`          |
| `make client`   | 💻   | Starts a MySQL client connected to the active database.                     | `make client`         |

### Starting a Database Instance

To start a specific database instance, use the `make <database_version>` command. The Makefile will automatically stop any currently running database instance before launching the new one, ensuring only one database (plus Traefik) runs at a time.

**MySQL**

| Command         | Icon | Description          |
| :-------------- | :--- | :------------------- |
| `make mysql93`  | 🐬   | Starts MySQL 9.3     |
| `make mysql84`  | 🐬   | Starts MySQL 8.4     |
| `make mysql80`  | 🐬   | Starts MySQL 8.0     |
| `make mysql57`  | 🐬   | Starts MySQL 5.7     |

**MariaDB**

| Command           | Icon | Description            |
| :---------------- | :--- | :--------------------- |
| `make mariadb114` | 🐧   | Starts MariaDB 11.4    |
| `make mariadb1011`| 🐧   | Starts MariaDB 10.11   |
| `make mariadb106` | 🐧   | Starts MariaDB 10.6    |

**Percona Server**

| Command          | Icon | Description               |
| :--------------- | :--- | :------------------------ |
| `make percona84` | ⚡   | Starts Percona Server 8.4 |
| `make percona80` | ⚡   | Starts Percona Server 8.0 |

**Example: Switching Databases**

```bash
# 1. You are working with MySQL 8.0
make mysql80

# 2. You want to switch to Percona 8.4. No need to stop manually.
make percona84
# This will stop mysql80 and then start percona84.
```

## 🏛️ Architecture

The system uses a **Traefik reverse proxy** as a smart router. It is the only service exposed on your host machine's port `3306` and automatically forwards traffic to the currently active database instance.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "💻 Your Host Machine"
        App[Your App / SQL Client]
    end

    subgraph "🐳 Docker Engine"
        direction LR
        subgraph "🚪 Single Entrypoint"
            Traefik[traefik-db-proxy<br/>proxy-for-db<br/>Listens on localhost:3306]
        end
        subgraph "🚀 On-Demand Database Container"
            ActiveDB["Active Database Instance<br/>e.g., mysql80, percona84<br/>Internal Docker Port"]
        end
    end

    App -- "Connects to localhost:3306" --> Traefik
    Traefik -- "Dynamically routes traffic to" --> ActiveDB
```

✨ **Traefik Dashboard**: To see this routing in action and inspect Traefik's configuration, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## 💡 Typical Workflow

Here is a diagram illustrating a common workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Choose DB Version};
    B --> C[Ex: make mysql84];
    C --> D{Launch MySQL 8.4};
    D --> E[Work with DB];
    subgraph "Possible Actions"
        direction LR
        F[Use make client]
        G[Check logs with make logs]
        H[Check status with make status]
    end
    E --> F & G & H;
    H --> I[Stop Environment];
    I --> J[make stop];
    J --> K[End];
```

1.  **Choose and start a database version**:
    ```bash
    make mysql84
    ```
2.  **(Optional but Recommended)** Generate your `~/.my.cnf` for easy client access:
    ```bash
    make mycnf
    ```
3.  **Connect using your preferred SQL client** to `localhost:3306` or use the provided Make command:
    ```bash
    make client
    ```
4.  **Develop and test** against the database.
5.  **Check logs** if needed:
    ```bash
    make logs
    ```
6.  **Switch to another database version** if required:
    ```bash
    make mariadb114
    ```
7.  When done, **stop the environment**:
    ```bash
    make stop
    ```
